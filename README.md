# SitecoreHostQuickStart
This repository contains a basic set of templates to help you get started building your own Sitecore Host applications.

The basic file structure was created from this article and also looking at the Sitecore Identity Server as it is built to follow Sitecore Host.

As you start using Sitecore Host we would love to have you contribute as it would help others as they get started.

The idea is to create a variety of templates so someone starting a new application can grab the one closest to what they need and then build on it.
If you would like to contribute as well reach out to Corey Smith (@sitecorey) or Chris Williams (@sitecoreguild) on twitter DM and we can add your github account so you can contribute.
